The Iron Yard is a personal hobby blog mainly related to a 1966 Mustang convertible project car project. Actually, the
blog itself is a meta-project: I am a software developer by day, and the blog itself is allowing me to learn a
little about Jekyll and GitHub pages.

Everyone is welcome to view - and perhaps somebody finds benefit in it somewhere - my primary audience is actually
myself. The plan is to completely dissassemble the car and then build it back, modifying various systems along the way
to produce a classic car suitable for everyday (well, maybe not everyday) driver.

## The current project: 1966 Mustang Convertible

The past ~9 months of Covid + WFH left me a little stir crazy, so I starting thinking about tackling a big project I
could work on at home. So, I've ended up with a 1966 Mustang Convertible in GT dress... The car looked decent enough at
first inspection, but the more I've dug into it, the more I became convinced to do it justice - it should be a full
teardown and rebuild. So, it's a lot more than I signed up for, but at same time - it's nice to have a challenge.

## About the Iron Yard name

Years ago my oldest child and I signed up for a "Coding for kids" class held by a local boot camp / incubator called The
Iron Yard. Sadly, that Iron Yard eventually went out of business, but the name always stuck with me. We're living in
Sacramento now, which has a rich history as one of the western railroad towns of the old west, and I enjoy looking at
all the old trains down in Old Town by the river.

When I started to plan this blog - thinking of 'old Detroit iron' (well, in the case of a Mustang, they were
build in Dearborn MI, San Jose CA, and Edison NJ), I remembered the Iron Yard from years ago. A little checking and a
domain name was available, so here we are.
