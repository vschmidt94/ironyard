What's planned next for car:

1. Unhook clutch cable from transmission
2. Unhook speedometer cable from transmission
3. Pull engine and transmission
    * right now short on space
4. Drain and remove gas tank
5. Figure out if I can get exhaust out somehow
6. Remove rear axle & suspension
7. Remove front suspension

## ToDo for Blog

Because I have a backlog of work here as well

1. Missing post on WordPress - recreate here. The day I removed driveshaft is missing.
2. Move parts list here (maybe?) see if it works.
