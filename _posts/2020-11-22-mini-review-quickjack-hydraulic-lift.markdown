There’s been a rash of catalytic converter thefts in my area, and even some in my neighborhood where catalytic
converters are stolen right off the vehicle overnight – even while parked in a driveway. From what I understand,
some cars can have the catalytic converter removed (ripped out) in a matter of minutes. Unfortunately, the 
Toyota Prius is a frequent target – and that’s what my daughter drives.  

Not only is it a nuisance to discover somebody robbed you, but it can be quite expensive to get the car repaired 
depending on the amount of damage done in addition to a not-cheap converter itself.  For a 2015 Prius, this is
running $ 1,750-2,000.

So I ordered a shield plate from Cat Security online.  While I had just searched online for something like this,
it was a pleasant surprise to learn that these guys are literally right down the road from me. I’ve since 
learned that the business locally is Cap City Muffler – but, the Cat Security product line is selling so well,
they’ve shut down the muffler shop and devote everything to their Cat Security line.

The package arrived 2 days after I placed the order online (like I said, right down the street).

Once I found a safe way to lift the Prius (see the review on QuickJack for more details) – installation was
very straightforward:

1. Remove the existing heat shield
2. Position the front half of the Cat Security Shield
3. Pop rivet in place using the existing heat shield holes
4. Drill a couple of 3/16″ holes for the tail end of the front shield and pop a couple of rivets back there.
5. Install the rear shield with 2 x self tapping screws and 2 pop rivets.
DONE

Any you end up with something looking about like this:

Total time spent was about an hour – if I had done one before, it would easily be about 15 minutes.

Hopefully this is at least enough to be a quick deterrent if the car ever gets targeted.
