It’s Thanksgiving vacation, so hopefully I’ll get to make some better progress over the next couple of days.

I’m sure in hindsight, I will wish I took a more structured approach – but mainly I look for the next “easy” thing
to remove and go from there.

Today:

* Trunk lid removed from hinges
* Rear brakelight / signal assemblies removed
* Rear bumper removed
* RHS front fender removed
  * Required pulling off the interior lower kick trim panels – not sure correct name for these guys.
  * Sadly, I’ll probably not restore with whatever homebuild speaker system the previous owner had
  * Again, finding miss-matched bolts, and at least 1 missing bolt on this one
* Battery removed – including its nice plywood base.

Oh, and the first part of the day was spent at CA DMV trying to get the car registered and titled. I’m new to CA,
and found their website didn’t exactly cover my particular case of titling a non-moving vehicle. For vehicles new
to the state, I know you are expected to present the vehicle at the DMV so they can confirm the VIN numbers, etc.
