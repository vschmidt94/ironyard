Not only is the Iron Yard a blog about a project car rebuild - it is a project itself.
I'm using the blog to learn a little about the [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) framework and using
static sites on GitHub pages.

Today I've begun the process of migrating the site away from WordPress to Jekyll and
I have hope it presents a much easier approach. My main goal here is to reduce the 
friction associated with adding a new post / new content. Wordpress _works_, but I end
up fighting it rather than just getting my thoughts captured.
