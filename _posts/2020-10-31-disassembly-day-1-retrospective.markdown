A week after the first workday on the car, I wanted to have a brief retrospective to get my “lessons learned” in order.

What I should have done better:

1. Be more organized
2. Be more organized
3. Be more organized
4. and probably taken more pictures
5. 
To be honest, I thought I had prepared to be organized going into the day – and only realized I wasn’t as organized as I thought I was after the fact when I was trying to put my notes in some semblance of order after the fact.

What I had:

1. Lots of parts / fasteners in bags with sometimes understandable, sometimes vague descriptions of where they came from
2. Lots of pictures on my iPad with cryptic annotations.
3. Lots of hand-written notes on same iPad with what was intended to be a play-by-play reporting

I let several days pass before sitting down and trying to set up better record-keeping. I know this is going to be a
long-running project – my personal goal is 2 years or so to get the car back on the road. So, I know I need to keep
records that will outlast my short-term memory on how things go together.

What I’ve done to improve:

1. Start up this website / blog
2. I’ve been wanting to start writing more on technical issues I’ve encountered as a software developer, and the Mustang project seems to be just one more technical project where a blog will help me organize my thoughts.
3. Setup a Google Sheets to track parts I pull off the car.
4. Tested out different programs to annotate images
5. Purchased some parts books with diagrams: Forel Publishing’s 1966 Mustang Parts & Body Illustrations

Now that I have the book – hopefully I can include some part numbers in my notes for cross referencing – and also I’m going to try to be better at finding legitimate names for the parts.
