# Disassembly of RHS Door

Just tossing up the picture gallery now while I’m taking inventory of parts…

Although I had grand plans of trying to do a detailed blog post with each step, I’m running
into the fact that there’s not enough hours available to spend a lot of time on writing up
a post at each step.

If anything, this is going to be more of a visual journal for me to look back on when the time
eventually gets here to put all the bits back together.

One thing I will note on this one though is I think I should have removed the front quarter 
vent windows FIRST.  I found a comment on another website that indicated “The front quarters
have to be removed first”.  Sadly, nobody explained this to me sooner, and it took a 
LOT OF WORK to wrestle the window glass out of the door.  Now I know why it was such a 
bear…  I’ll try to correct way on the LHS door.
