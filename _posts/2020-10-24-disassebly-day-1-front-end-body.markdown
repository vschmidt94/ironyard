Today was the first day of the 66 Mustang restoration project, and my daughters and I began tearing
the car apart, err… “disassembly” as the pros say.

My intent is to follow [Don Taylor’s Classic Mustang Restoration Handbook](https://www.amazon.com/dp/0895864029)
as much as I can – starting with the front of the car.

However, I’m quickly learning that this car – and probably any car 54 years old – I’m having to make 
adjustments on the fly.  The biggest issue is it looks like at one point there was some minor accident
involving the front passenger side. the bumper is pushed in just enough to hide the nuts from easy access
from underneath, etc. – so we’re freehanding a bit to remove the parts that are easiest to get to.

My apologies up front – I’m not writing this blog for you, the reader. I’m writing this blog for me –
for when I need to put Humpty Dumpty back together again.  So, don’t expect much of a narrative – consider it
more of a build log.
