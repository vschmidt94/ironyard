I picked up 2 sets of these tire dollies from Harbor Freight, and sharing first impressions.

These guys: [1500 lb tire dollies](https://www.harborfreight.com/2-piece-1500-lb-capacity-vehicle-dollies-67338.html)

To give you some idea of my garage setup at home: I have a 2-bay garage and a 1-bay garage. The 1-bay 
is pretty much my “workshop” and storage.  Shelves on 1 side and my toolbox on the other wall.
The Mustang project is in the 2-bay, shared with my wife’s car.  So, on the weekends when I have time
to work, the plan is to back her car out of the garage, roll the Mustang on the dollies to the center
to where I have plenty of space on all sides.

So far, this _works_ but it’s not an easy push. I usually have to get down and get the wheels on the
dollies going the correct direction and then push.  I’m thinking it’s going to be a huge difference
when the engine and transmission get pulled (If I do that here, considering renting a bay at the
Sacramento Classic Car DIY Club).

That said, I may also go shopping for a little heavier caster wheel set with bearings. I suspect
buying 16 replacement casters is going to easily outpace the ~$80 I have invested in the dollies
at the moment.

Right now, I think I’ll give them 7 out of 10, mainly for the utility-to-cost ratio.
