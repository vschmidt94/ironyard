# First parts starting to arrive

The boxes have starting showing up:
  * From Forte's Parts Connection:
    * IRS Center Section - 3.55 gear ratio
    * Ford hubs
    * Rear IRS knuckle
  * From Breeze Automotive:
    * Cubby
    * Batter box for moving to engine compartment
    * Eccentric bushings for steering rack
    * Fan Shroud
    * Cowling
  * From Factory Five Forum member:
    * Drop Trunk Kit

# And got to actually DO something!

Now that I actually have some parts, I can legitimately start working on _something_!

Today:
  * Cut off the ear peice from LH / RH rear steering knuckle
    * Used the recommended SawZall method with wood blade
      * Cut much better with a drop of TapMagic every so often
      * Cleaned up nice on the sander
  * Removed wheel lugs from hub/spindle assembly.

And that's as much as I can do right now, but a sense of getting started at least.
