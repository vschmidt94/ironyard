# Day 4 Disassembly notes: LHS Door glass

This time I went with removing the vent glass assembly first in hopes it would make removing
the main glass easier. Nope – main glass was still a pain in the a$$ to get out.  All the other 
parts came out fairly quickly as I now had previous experience to draw on.  What was left in the
end was the main glass inside the door cavity. The troublesome part is on the lower frame there
are these spots where the metal flares outward to catch the upper limit stops. But they also
catch on the upper window opening lip. It took prying the window lip out of the way a bit to
finally pull the glass out.

Also removed the RHS vent window which remained.

Note the RHS door does not have a side view mirror – that is only found on LHS door. 
It was removed as well.
