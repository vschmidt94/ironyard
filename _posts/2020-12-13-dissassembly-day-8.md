# D8: Exhaust, Carb, Seats

Looks like I’ve missed a day of work – I’ll have to recreate what I did on Day 7 work and catch up.
That said, since I just walked in from the garage, I’m going to get my notes down right away while
fresh in my mind.

Today the primary goal is getting the engine and transmission unhooked from everything else,
but made a few detours along the way.

 * Removed rear valance panel
 * Including removing back up lights
 * Removed quarter panel extensions
 * Removed 4 exhaust u-bolts, but looks like joints are welded anyway.
 * Unbolted exhaust from headers
   * right now zip ties holding up front exhaust
 * Disconnected fuel line to engine
 * Unhooked throttle linkage – note it looks like bolts are missing at the firewall mount
 * Removed carburetor
 * Removed center console
 * Disconnect and remove manual shifter
 * Unbolted from seats from body
 * 
Basically the main things left connecting to the engine and transmission are the clutch cable and speedometer cable.  I felt I should do a little better research on disconnecting those items before I really screwed something up.
