In keeping with my running theme of “take apart anything I can see screws and nuts for” – the rear quarter 
windows were easy to access at this point.

This video was helpful:

Much like the guys in the video, found a bit of busted up gear when I got into it
Disassembly involved removing:
 * rubber seal at upper rear door pillar
 * the inside vertical track (uses the short fasteners)
 * Removing lower limit bumpers
 * Winder assembly (somehow got this out the bottom gap – no idea how it goes back
 * Slider assembly with tracks
 * Glass out the top
 * Felt weatherstripping on either side
