Remember that part where I said I was going to try to be more organized in
disassembly and work more logically on major components.  It’s still easier
to move on parts that I see can come off easily…  Part of this was related
to not being able to roll the car over in the garage, so I was very confined
on drivers side with more room on passenger side, and also with the top down,
easy to access the interior.
