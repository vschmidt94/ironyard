As I've been taking the Mustang apart, I'm realizing this car wasn't always repaired as it should have been. More than
likely one owner was a carpenter or had a nice collection of woodscrews, and other parts.

So far, I’ve found:

* Wood screws
  * One holding on headlight bucket assembly
  * Various others mainly around trim and cosmetic parts
 * Toggle wall anchors
 * Newspaper shims
 * Metric bolts (only 1 so far, thank goodness)
 * Wooden dowel doing *something* with the covertible hydraulic ram

That said, all that reinforces my belief that while the car wasn’t in terrible condition to start with – it was a far cry from a junkyard salvage – there’s enough wonkiness that really should be fixed up.

I have no intention of this being a concours restoration – but I want it to be correct-ish.

Should have taken more pictures
