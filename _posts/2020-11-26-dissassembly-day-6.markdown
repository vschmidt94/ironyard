Thanksgiving break – so a little more time to work on the car.

Today:

 * Removed LHS Fender
 * Removed export brace, including shock tower tops
 * Removed rubber weatherstripping thing at cowl-to-hood area of engine bay
 * Got it up on the QuickJack
 * Wheels off
 * Started cleaning out engine bay as looking to pull engine and transmission
 * Not a lot to say here, just some pictures and a video of the QuickJack in action

The video is a little fuzzy, but just think that the QuickJack is pretty cool…
